Hello and welcome! I’m Kodchakorn Khemtonglang (People called me Sydney). I recently completed my master's degree in Bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with the support from the Fulbright Scholarship. Before that, I have completed my undergraduate study in Chemical engineering from Khon Kaen University (second-class hornor), with the support from the Panasonic Scholarship. This space is dedicated to sharing my academic journey, research interests, and professional growth as I delve into the world of academia and entrepreneur.

About Me
======

I’m passionate about biosensors, specifially wearable biosensors and bioelectronics. I am an engineer with the love for biology. My research interest focuses on merging the beauty between engineering and biology to create a personalized teachnology for a better health. 

Outside of a research lab, I love putting myself into voluntary works and non-profit organizations. I have involved in TEDxKhonKaenU for 4 years, TEDxUIUC for 2 years, and I have been to more than 10 TEDx events. I also explored my entreprenerial interest through working with the Young Entrepreneur Assembly Hub (YEAH) in Thailand as a program manager for the YEAH Leadership Program 2024: Visionaries in the Making.

In my free time (besides lab and volunteer), I always make time for the gym. I am a hybrid athlete with an interest in CrossFit, HIIT, running, weight-training, and badminton. I also love journaling, playing with my cats, trying out new foods, traveling, and learning new languages.
